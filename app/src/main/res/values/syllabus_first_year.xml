            processed data. Details of functional units of a computer. Storage
            – primary storage and secondary storage.

            \n(The discussion should focus more on the functionalities of the units and their
            interaction than on specific hardware details. However, concepts like memory cells and
            their addressability (need not be binary), registers, inter- connections (buses) have to
            introduced at an abstract level. For storage devices – primary and secondary –, various
            categories have to be introduced along with their distinguishing features. For I-O
            devices also, various categories are to be introduced. The Von Neumann concept should be
            effectively introduced. History computers need not be taught. However, students have to
            be encouraged to read the relevant sections of the text book. Chapters 1 – 4 of ‘Goel’
            may be used to support teaching -learning.)

            \n(For all the above topics, focus should be more on the concepts, significance and
            objectives. Chapter 6 and 7 (up to 7.4) of ‘Goel’ may be used to support the
            teaching-learning process.)
